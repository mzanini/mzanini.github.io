I have recently read the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805">Drive</a>, by Daniel Pink. The book talks about motivation and how to cultivate it. One of the strategies to find purpose and therefore motivation is to think about "your sentence". Pink took the idea from Clare Boothe Luce, one of the first women to serve in the U.S. congress who, in 1962, famously stated that "a great man is a sentence". I strongly encourage to read this great book or to find out more about the concept <a href="http://www.danpink.com/2011/01/whats-your-sentence-the-video/">here</a> on Dan Pink's blog. <br/>

This is my sentence. It will change with me, it will remain a moving target that shows purpose when I need it most.
