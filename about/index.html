title: About Marco Zanini
---
<img id="about_picture" src="me.jpg"/>
<p>My name is Marco Zanini, I am an Information Engineer currently living in the Seattle Area.</p> 

<p>I enjoy building information products that help people and companies communicate with each other. While I love C++ and Java, I have a growing interest for Web technologies like Javascript/Node.js and Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>Me and my wife are outdoorsy people and we do enjoy hiking on the mountains nearby, skiing, running, climbing. Not surprising since I was born and spent my childhood in <a href="http://www.tr3ntino.it/en/trentino/lago-di-garda/arco/">Arco, Trentino, Italy</a>!</p>

<p>If I sound like an interesting person to talk to/propose an interesting paid or unpaid project, <a href="/contact">let's get in touch</a>!</p>
