<p>This page shows a simple javascript application that connects to <a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a>, retrieves the list of read items and puts them in a list. Items are sorted with the newest item first. All you need to do is to create a new application on the <a href="https://getpocket.com/developer/apps/">Pocket developer portal</a> with <em>Retrieve</em> permission. Then input the consumer key in the box and click <b>Show read items</b>. Apologies if this step is not automatic but I am trying to find out how to make everything work with the limitations of github pages, where this website is currently hosted.</p>
<p>The consumer key is just saved in your browser's session storage</p> 

Consumer key: <input type="text" id="consumerKeyId"><br>
<button onclick="populateReadItems()">Show read items</button>

<div id="readItems"></div>

<script src="index.js"></script>
